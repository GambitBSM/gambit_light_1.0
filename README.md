GAMBIT-light
============

**GAMBIT-light** is a powerful yet easy-to-use tool for computationally difficult statistical fits and optimisation tasks. The user can provide their target/likelihood function as a Python, C, C++ or Fortran library.

Some features of GAMBIT-light:

  - A unified interface to a collection of powerful, MPI-parallelised sampling/optimisation algorithms
  - Simple interface for connecting user-supplied target/likelihood functions (and sampling priors, if needed) as runtime plugins 
  - Outputs in different file formats (binary or text)
  - Systems for exception handling and logging
  - Safe shutdown and resuming of aborted runs
  - Run configuration via a simple YAML file

GAMBIT-light is a spin-off project from **GAMBIT** (the Global And Modular BSM Inference Tool), https://gambitbsm.org/, a software tool for large-scale statistical fits in particle physics and astrophysics.

Supported Compilers and Library Dependencies
--

GAMBIT-light is built using the CMake system. The following libraries and packages must be installed prior to configuration:

**COMPULSORY**:

 - gcc >= 9 / llvm clang >= 10 / AppleClang >= 13 / icc >= 15.0.2
 - gfortran >= 9 / ifort >=15.0.2
 - Cmake 2.8.12 or greater
 - Python 3
 - Python modules: yaml, future, os, re, datetime, sys, getopt, shutil and itertools.
 - git
 - Boost 1.48 or greater
 - Eigen 3.1.0 or greater
 - GNU Scientific Library (GSL) 2.1 or greater
 - LAPACK
 - pkg-config

**OPTIONAL**:

 - HDF5 (for use of the hdf5 printer)
 - MPI (required for parallel sampling)
 - axel (speeds up downloads of scanners)
 - Python modules:
    - h5py (required to use hdf5 utilities located in gambit/Printers/scripts)


Building GAMBIT-light
--

GAMBIT-light itself is a C++ code. You build it once, and afterwards you connect your own target/likelihood function code to GAMBIT-light as a runtime plugin, in the form of a Python code or a C/C++/Fortran shared library. 

GAMBIT-light supports Linux and Mac OSX. (On Windows you can run it through WSL or Cygwin.) A full walkthrough of how to install all dependencies and build GAMBIT-light with AppleClang on OSX can be found in the file `README_OSX.md`.

Note that CMake might fail to find some dependencies on some systems without guidance. If you encounter problems configuring or building GAMBIT-light, have a look in `BUILD_OPTIONS.md` for a list of commonly used build options.

Here is a basic example of how to build GAMBIT-light and the full collection of "scanners" (sampling/optimisation libraries):

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DEIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/eigen -DWITH_MPI=On -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-11 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-11 -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=gfortran-11 ..
make -jN scanners   # where N is the number of cores to use for the build, e.g. 4
cmake ..            # this step is needed for GAMBIT to detect the built scanners
make -jN gambit
```

(If you prefer to turn off compiler optimisations, use `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=None` instead of `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`.)

Instead of building all the scanners (`make -jN scanners`) you can build each scanner you need individually, e.g.

```
make -jN diver
make -jN multinest
make -jN polychord
```

If for some reason you need to restart the build process, you can clean out the previous build as follows:

```
cd build
make nuke-all
cd ..
rm -r build
```


Running GAMBIT-light
--

A GAMBIT-light run is configured with a single YAML file. A fully commented example is provided in `yaml_files/gambit_light_example.yaml`. You can run GAMBIT-light with this example configuration by doing

```
./gambit -f yaml_files/gambit_light_example.yaml
```

To see a complete list of command-line options, do 
```
./gambit --help
```

When using an MPI-parallelised scanner, start GAMBIT-light with `mpiexec` or `mpirun`, e.g.

```
mpiexec -np 4 ./gambit -f yaml_files/your_configuration_file.yaml
```

for a run with 4 MPI processes.



Connecting your own target/likelihood function
--

For step-by-step instructions on how to connect your own Python/C/C++/Fortran code to GAMBIT-light, see the README files and example codes in the 
`gambit_light_interface/example_*` directories.



Common issues
--

- **Multiple Python installations**: If you have multiple versions of Python installed on your system, or you are working with a Python virtual environment, it is recommended to manually set the paths to the specific Python library and header files that GAMBIT-light should use. This can be done via the flags `PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR` and `PYTHON_LIBRARIES` in the cmake command, e.g. like this:
  ```
  cmake -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python3.10 -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.10.so (the rest of the cmake command) ..
  ```
  If needed, the `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` flag can be used to ensure that GAMBIT-light also uses the correct Python executable, e.g. `-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3`.

- **Multiple HDF5 libraries**: GAMBIT-light can fail to build or run due to conflicting versions of the HDF5 library. The most common source of this problem is that the Python package `h5py` has been built against an HDF5 version that differs from the version already installed on the system. One solution can be to reinstall `h5py` as follows:
  ```
  pip3 uninstall h5py
  pip3 install --no-binary=h5py h5py
  ```
  If needed, you can specify the specific HDF5 version that h5py should be built against:
  ```
  pip3 uninstall h5py
  HDF5_VERSION=1.10.7 pip3 install --no-binary=h5py h5py  
  ```
