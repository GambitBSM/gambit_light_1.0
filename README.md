GAMBIT-light
============

GAMBIT-light is a powerful yet easy-to-use tool for computationally difficult statistical fits and global optimisation tasks, with user-supplied target/likelihood functions connected as Python, C, C++ or Fortran libraries. 

Some features of GAMBIT-light:

  - A unified interface to a collection of powerful, MPI-parallelised sampling/optimisation algorithms
  - Simple interface for connecting user-supplied target/likelihood functions (and sampling priors, if needed) as runtime plugins 
  - Outputs in different file formats (binary or text)
  - Systems for exception handling and logging
  - Safe shutdown and resuming of aborted runs
  - Run configuration via a simple YAML file

GAMBIT-light is a spin-off project from GAMBIT (the Global And Modular BSM Inference Tool), https://gambitbsm.org/, a software tool designed for performing large-scale statistical fits of new models in particle physics and astrophysics.

Supported Compilers and Library Dependencies
--

GAMBIT-light is built using the CMake system. The following libraries and packages must be installed prior to configuration:

COMPULSORY:

 - gcc >= 5.1 / llvm clang >= 10 / AppleClang >= 13 / icc >= 15.0.2
 - gfortran >= 5.1 / ifort >=15.0.2
 - Cmake 2.8.12 or greater
 - Python 3
 - Python modules: yaml, future, os, re, datetime, sys, getopt, shutil and itertools.
 - git
 - Boost 1.48 or greater
 - GNU Scientific Library (GSL) 2.1 or greater
 - LAPACK
 - pkg-config

OPTIONAL:

 - HDF5 (for use of the hdf5 printer)
 - MPI (required for parallel sampling)
 - axel (speeds up downloads of backends and scanners)
 - Python modules:
    - numpy 1.12 or greater (required for using any python backend)
    - h5py (required to use hdf5 utilities located in gambit/Printers/scripts)


Building GAMBIT-light
--

GAMBIT-light itself is a C++ code that you only have to build once. Afterwards you connect your own target/likelihood function code to GAMBIT-light as a runtime plugin, in the form of a Python code or a C/C++/Fortran shared library. 

GAMBIT-light supports Linux and Mac OSX. (On Windows, you can run it through WSL or Cygwin.) A full walkthrough of how to install all dependencies and build GAMBIT-light with AppleClang on OSX can be found in the file README_OSX.md.

Note that cmake might fail to find some dependencies on some systems without guidance. If you encounter problems configuring or building GAMBIT-light, have a look in BUILD_OPTIONS.md for a list of commonly used build options.

Here is a basic example of how to build GAMBIT-light and full collection of "scanners" (sampling/optimisation libraries):

```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DWITH_MPI=On -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-11 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-11 -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=gfortran-11 ..
  make -jN scanners   # where N is the number of cores to use for the build, e.g. 4
  cmake ..            # this step is needed for GAMBIT to detect the built scanners
  make -jN gambit
```

(If you prefer to turn off compiler optimisations, use `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=None` instead of `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`.)

Instead of building all the scanners (`make -jN scanners`) you can build each scanner you need individually, e.g.

```
  make -jN diver
  make -jN multinest
  make -jN polychord
```

If for some reason you need to restart the build process, you can clean out the previous build as follows:

```
  cd build
  make nuke-all
  cd ..
  rm -r build
```


Connecting your own target/likelihood function
--

For step-by-step instructions on how to connect your own Python/C/C++/Fortran code to GAMBIT-light, see the README files and example codes in the 
`gambit_light_interface/example_*` directories.


Running GAMBIT-light
--

A GAMBIT-light run is configured with a single YAML file. An commented example is provided in `yaml_files/gambit_light_example.yaml`. To run GAMBIT with this example configuration do

```
  ./gambit -f yaml_files/gambit_light_example.yaml
```

To see a full list of command-line options, do 
```
  ./gambit --help
```

When using an MPI-parallelised scanner, start GAMBIT with `mpiexec` or `mpirun`, e.g.

```
  mpiexec -np 4 ./gambit -f yaml_files/your_configuration_file.yaml
```
