GAMBIT-light
============

**GAMBIT-light** is a powerful yet easy-to-use tool for computationally difficult statistical fits and optimisation tasks. The user can provide their target/likelihood function as a Python, C, C++ or Fortran library.

Some features of GAMBIT-light:

  - A unified interface to a collection of powerful, MPI-parallelised sampling/optimisation algorithms
  - Simple interface for connecting user-supplied target/likelihood functions (and sampling priors, if needed) as runtime plugins 
  - Outputs in different file formats (binary or text)
  - Systems for exception handling and logging
  - Safe shutdown and resuming of aborted runs
  - Run configuration via a simple YAML file

GAMBIT-light is a spin-off project from **GAMBIT** (the Global And Modular BSM Inference Tool), https://gambitbsm.org/, a software tool for large-scale statistical fits in particle physics and astrophysics. If you use GAMBIT-light, please cite the papers listed in the Citation section below.

    - h5py (required to use hdf5 utilities located in gambit/Printers/scripts)


Building GAMBIT-light
--

GAMBIT-light itself is a C++ code. You build it once, and afterwards you connect your own target/likelihood function code to GAMBIT-light as a runtime plugin, in the form of a Python code or a C/C++/Fortran shared library. 

GAMBIT-light supports Linux and Mac OSX. (On Windows you can run it through WSL or Cygwin.) A full walkthrough of how to install all dependencies and build GAMBIT-light with AppleClang on OSX can be found in the file `README_OSX.md`.

Note that CMake might fail to find some dependencies on some systems without guidance. If you encounter problems configuring or building GAMBIT-light, have a look in `BUILD_OPTIONS.md` for a list of commonly used build options.

Here is a basic example of how to build GAMBIT-light and the full collection of "scanners" (sampling/optimisation libraries):

```console
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DEIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/eigen -DWITH_MPI=On -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-11 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-11 -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=gfortran-11 ..
make -jN scanners   # where N is the number of cores to use for the build, e.g. 4
cmake ..            # this step is needed for GAMBIT to detect the built scanners
make -jN gambit
```

(If you prefer to turn off compiler optimisations, use `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=None` instead of `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`.)

Instead of building all the scanners (`make -jN scanners`) you can build each scanner you need individually, e.g.

```console
make -jN diver
make -jN multinest
make -jN polychord
```

If for some reason you need to restart the build process, you can clean out the previous build as follows:

```console
cd build
make nuke-all
cd ..
rm -r build
```


Running GAMBIT-light
--

A GAMBIT-light run is configured with a single YAML file. A fully commented example is provided in `yaml_files/gambit_light_example.yaml`. You can run GAMBIT-light with this example configuration by doing

```console
./gambit -rf yaml_files/gambit_light_example.yaml
```

To see a complete list of command-line options, do 
```console
./gambit --help
```

When using an MPI-parallelised scanner, start GAMBIT-light with `mpiexec` or `mpirun`, e.g.

```console
mpiexec -np 4 ./gambit -rf yaml_files/your_configuration_file.yaml
```

for a run with 4 MPI processes.



Connect your own target/likelihood function
--

For step-by-step instructions on how to connect your own Python/C/C++/Fortran code to GAMBIT-light, see the README files and example codes in the 
`gambit_light_interface/example_*` directories.



Get GAMBIT plotting tools
--

To download a set of Python plotting tools for making 1D/2D profile likelihood and posterior plots from GAMBIT and GAMBIT-light output files, do:

```console
cd build
make get-gambit_plotting_tools
cd ..
```

The plotting tools will be downloaded to a folder `gambit_plotting_tools`. You can either run your plotting scripts from this folder or pip install the package: 

```console
pip install ./gambit_plotting_tools
```

Fully worked example from scan to plotting
--

This example performs a two-parameter scan that uses the (negative) Rosenbrock function as an example log-likelihood function for which we want to identify the best-fit point and map out the 1sigma and 2sigma confidence regions. The scan is performed using the Diver differential evolution scanner and should take around one minute when running with a single MPI process. The scan output is written to the directory `runs/gambit_light_example_rosenbrock_scan`.

- Run GAMBIT scan:

  ```console
  ./gambit -rf yaml_files/gambit_light_example_rosenbrock_scan.yaml
  ```

- Download the GAMBIT plotting tools (see above).

- Modify the beginning of the script `gambit_plotting_tools/example_gambit_light_2D_profile_like_hdf5.py` to point to your GAMBIT output file in `runs/gambit_light_example_rosenbrock_scan/samples/results.hdf5`.

- Make a 2D profile likelihood plot:

  ```console
  cd gambit_plotting_tools
  python example_gambit_light_2D_profile_like_hdf5.py
  ```

  This should give a plot looking something like this:
  
  <img src="example_results/2D_profile__x1__x2__LogLike.png" alt="2D profile likelihood example plot" width="400"/>


Common issues
--

- **Multiple Python installations**: If you have multiple versions of Python installed on your system, or you are working with a Python virtual environment, it is recommended to manually set the paths to the specific Python library and header files that GAMBIT-light should use. This can be done via the flags `PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR` and `PYTHON_LIBRARIES` in the cmake command, e.g. like this:
  ```console
  cmake -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python3.10 -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.10.so (the rest of the cmake command) ..
  ```
  If needed, the `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` flag can be used to ensure that GAMBIT-light also uses the correct Python executable, e.g. `-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3`.

- **Multiple HDF5 libraries**: GAMBIT-light can fail to build or run due to conflicting versions of the HDF5 library. The most common source of this problem is that the Python package `h5py` has been built against an HDF5 version that differs from the version already installed on the system. One solution can be to reinstall `h5py` as follows:
  ```console
  pip3 uninstall h5py
  pip3 install --no-binary=h5py h5py
  ```
  If needed, you can specify the specific HDF5 version that h5py should be built against:
  ```console
  $ pip3 uninstall h5py
  $ HDF5_VERSION=1.10.7 pip3 install --no-binary=h5py h5py  
  ```
- **HDF5-related segmentation fault**: GAMBIT-light has two separate systems ("printers") for writing HDF5 output files. If using the YAML file option 
  ```yaml
  Printer:
    printer: hdf5
  ```
  leads to a segmentation fault (this issue is most commonly seen on Mac), then try switiching to the older HDF5 printer by using
  ```yaml
  Printer:
    printer: hdf5_v1
  ```

- **hdf5_v1 printer and the multinest scanner**: The multinest scanner currently cannot be used together with the hdf5_v1 printer.

- **gambit plotting tools throwing errors about axis syntax**: Much older versions of matplotlib may not allow the syntax used to create profile likelihood plots. This would require upgrading the matplotlib version.
